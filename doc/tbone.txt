COMMANDS                                        *tbone*

These commands will be available if and only if tmux is in your PATH.

                                                *tbone-:Tmux*
:Tmux [args]            Invoke an arbitrary tmux command.

                                                *tbone-:Tput*
:[line]Tput [buffer]    Put the text from the given tmux buffer (default 0)
                        after [line] (default current line).

                                                *tbone-:Tyank*
:[range]Tyank [buffer]  Yank [range] lines into the given tmux buffer (default
                        new).

                                                *tbone-:Twrite*
:[range]Twrite [pane]   Take the text indicated by [range], strip leading
                        whitespace, change newlines to carriage returns, and
                        stuff it into [pane] using `tmux send-keys` (default
                        previously specified).

:Twrite [pane]          With no range, sends the current line without a
                        trailing carriage return.

                                                *tbone-:Tattach*
:Tattach {session}      Force use of a particular tmux session.  You only need
                        this if you started Vim outside of tmux.

:Tattach                Revert back to the default tmux session.  You might
                        think of this as "detaching".
