COMMANDS                                        *tbone*

These commands will be available if and only if tmux is in your PATH.

                                                *tbone-:Tmux*
:Tmux [args]               Invoke an arbitrary tmux command.

                                                *tbone-:Tput*
:[line]Tput [buffer]       Put the text from the given tmux buffer (default
                           most recent) after [line] (default current line).

                                                *tbone-:Tyank*
:[range]Tyank [buffer]     Yank [range] lines into the given tmux buffer
                           (default new).

                                                *tbone-:Twrite*
:[range]Twrite[!] [pane]   Take the text indicated by [range], strip leading
                           whitespace, change newlines to carriage returns,
                           and stuff it into [pane] using `tmux send-keys`.
                           To preserve leading whitespace, use a "!".
                           (default previously specified).

:Twrite [pane]             With no range, sends the current line without a
                           trailing carriage return.

                                                *tbone-:Tattach*
:Tattach {session}         Force use of a particular tmux session.  You only
                           need this if you started Vim outside of tmux.

:Tattach                   Revert back to the default tmux session.  You might
                           think of this as "detaching".
